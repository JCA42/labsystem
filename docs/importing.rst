Importing
=========

Labs created for *labsystem* can be easily imported into the new system. A import script has been provided to achieve this::

  ./import.sh lab.zip imported.zip [true]

The lab must be in a zip archive and a new archive is generated containing the imported lab. If the last parameter is *true* then the archive is automatically expanded  and becomes useful to the application.
